this is my project to create a modular structure scanner that can have custom loot tables for randomized inventories
with the possibility to add more moduals to increase the compatability with mods.
the second goal of this is to make its setup as painless as possible so that you just have to have the right hardware and the setup script will auto decide which mod compatibility files you need
